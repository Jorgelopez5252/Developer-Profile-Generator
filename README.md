Description
This is a command line program. The program starts by asking for a GitHub username and a favorite color. With this information the code makes a server side ajax call with Axios to get user information from GitHub. Once the calls are returned the data compiled into a string literal with variables. This string is then output to an HTML file and the string is also converted to a PDF file. The PDF is the desired final output of the assignment​
